        <h1>Project: Secure Help Desk Ticketing System</h1>
        <p class="tech-used">Technologies Used: Python, Flask, SQLite, HTML/CSS, JSON</p>

            <h2>1. The Challenge</h2>
            <p>
                The goal was to build a full-stack application to streamline the submission and management of IT support tickets. The core **security challenge** was ensuring **data integrity**, maintaining a clear **audit trail**, and implementing robust **access control** in a simulated multi-user environment.
            </p>

            <h2>2. My Role & Security Process</h2>
            <p>
                I was the sole developer. The process involved defining a schema for ticket data (priority, status, user ID), designing a user authentication and session management system, and developing CRUD functionality using Flask for the backend and SQLite for persistent storage.
            </p>
            <p>
                **Key Security Implementation:**
                <ul>
                    <li>**Access Control:** Implemented basic **user roles (Staff vs. Admin)** and session management to ensure only authenticated staff could manage and prioritize tickets.</li>
                    <li>**Secure Logging & Auditing:** Developed a feature to **export all ticket logs in JSON format**. This simulates real-world requirements for easy, machine-readable auditing and secure backup outside the live database.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>3. Results & Impact</h2>
            <p>
                The system was tested with over 40 sample tickets. The implementation of priority sorting and escalation rules led to a simulated **35% reduction in response time** in testing scenarios. The detailed technical walkthroughs created as part of the project simulate real-world training documentation.
